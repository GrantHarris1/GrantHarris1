                Hello, my name is Grant Harris. Thank you for visiting my page. I am a new Web Developer in Lexington, Ky. 
                I've spent most of my life here in Kentucky. My work history started when I joined the army in 2003. The Next
                Chapter of my life was as an industrial electrician. I did that for more than 12 years. My new work is in
                web development, where my passion is. I have 5 wonderful kids, and have been married to Brittany for 18 years.
                I love the tech industry and cannot wait to see where this journey takes me.
